# haha-separator

**haha-separator** is a Python program for separating an inputted ***"Haha"*** to ***"Ha ha"*** regardless of the format in a message.

The program can be used to imitate how Sir [Arvic](https://www.facebook.com/kulotsystem) say
***"haha"*** in chat conversations.  You can use your regular sentence construction in your message and
add as many ***"haha's"*** the way you used to write them, but the message will appear as if it was sent by him.
